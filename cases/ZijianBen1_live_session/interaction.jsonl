{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there! I'm WildfireGPT, your friendly wildfire risk consultant. With access to comprehensive wildfire datasets, I'm here to help you understand and prepare for potential risks in your area.\n\nTo provide the most relevant information, I'll start by working through a checklist of questions about your background and concerns prior to our consultation session. Your responses will help me tailor my recommendations to your unique situation. If you're unsure about any question, feel free to say \"I don't know.\"\n\nOnce I have a clear understanding of your needs, I'll summarize our discussion and create a plan to address your concerns. This will include the datasets we'll analyze and the types of recommendations I can provide.\n\nWhen you're happy with the plan, we'll proceed according to the agreed-upon steps. Feel free to ask questions at any point in the process.\n\nI'm looking forward to working with you to help you better understand and prepare for wildfire risks. Let's get started with our first question: \n\n**What is the location you're concerned about regarding wildfire risks?** You can describe a specific address, city, or part of a region. We can also use latitude and longitude coordinates if you have them. If you're unsure, we can work together to identify the exact location. (As of now, WildfireGPT only analyzes wildfire risks within 36km (22 miles) of a given location specified by latitude and longitude.)\n"}
